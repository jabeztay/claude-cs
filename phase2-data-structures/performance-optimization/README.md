# Performance & Advanced Features

**Duration:** Week 7-8 (14 days)  
**Phase:** Data Structures in Action

## Learning Objectives
- Understand performance optimization techniques
- Learn about caching and memory management
- Grasp concurrent access patterns

## Project Goal
Enhance key-value store with performance optimizations

## Enhancement Options
Choose 2-3 of the following:

### 1. Bloom Filters
- Probabilistic data structure for faster negative lookups
- Reduce unnecessary disk I/O
- Configurable false positive rates

### 2. LRU Cache Implementation
- Least Recently Used caching strategy
- Memory-efficient cache management
- Cache hit/miss statistics

### 3. Compression and Space Optimization
- Data compression algorithms
- Space-efficient storage formats
- Compression ratio analysis

### 4. Concurrent Access Patterns
- Thread-safe operations
- Read/write locks
- Concurrent performance testing

## Performance Metrics
- Throughput (operations per second)
- Latency (response time)
- Memory usage
- Disk I/O efficiency

## Deliverable
Enhanced key-value store with:
- 2-3 performance optimizations implemented
- Comprehensive benchmarking suite
- Performance analysis and documentation
- Integration with previous phase components
