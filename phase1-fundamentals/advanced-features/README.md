# Advanced Features & Optimization

**Duration:** Week 7-8 (14 days)  
**Phase:** Computer Systems Fundamentals

## Learning Objectives
- Understand advanced language features
- Learn optimization techniques
- Explore debugging capabilities

## Project Goal
Enhance your VM and compiler with advanced features

## Enhancement Options
Pick 2-3 of the following:

### 1. Garbage Collection
- Simple mark-and-sweep algorithm
- Memory management automation
- Object lifecycle tracking

### 2. Function Calls
- Call stack implementation
- Local variable scoping
- Parameter passing mechanisms

### 3. Debugging Features
- Step-through debugger
- Breakpoint system
- Variable inspection

### 4. Optimization
- Constant folding
- Dead code elimination
- Basic peephole optimization

### 5. Standard Library
- Built-in functions and modules
- File I/O operations
- String manipulation
