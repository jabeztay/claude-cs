# Query Processing

**Duration:** Week 3-4 (14 days)  
**Phase:** Database Internals

## Learning Objectives
- Understand SQL parsing and AST generation
- Learn about query planning and optimization
- Grasp different join algorithms

## Project Goal
Build a SQL subset parser and query executor

## Implementation Features
- SQL parsing and AST generation
- Query plan optimization
- Multiple join algorithms
- Basic query execution engine

```

## SQL Subset Support
- SELECT statements with WHERE clauses
- JOIN operations (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
- Basic aggregation (COUNT, SUM, AVG)
- ORDER BY and GROUP BY clauses

## Join Algorithms
1. **Nested Loop Join:** Simple but inefficient
2. **Hash Join:** Memory-efficient for large datasets
3. **Sort-Merge Join:** Efficient for sorted data

## Query Optimization
- Cost-based optimization
- Join order optimization
- Predicate pushdown
- Index utilization

## Deliverable
Query processor with:
- SQL parsing capabilities
- Query plan generation
- Multiple join algorithm implementations
- Basic query optimization

## Performance Targets
- Efficient query execution
- Optimal join algorithm selection
- Memory-efficient processing
