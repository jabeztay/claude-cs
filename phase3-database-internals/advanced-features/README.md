# Advanced Database Features

**Duration:** Week 9-10 (14 days)  
**Phase:** Database Internals

## Learning Objectives
- Understand advanced database optimization
- Learn about recovery and replication
- Grasp different storage architectures

## Project Goal
Enhance database engine with advanced features

## Enhancement Options
Choose 2-3 of the following:

### 1. Query Optimization with Statistics
- Table and column statistics collection
- Cardinality estimation
- Cost-based query optimization
- Query plan caching

### 2. WAL-based Recovery
- Write-ahead logging implementation
- Crash recovery procedures
- Checkpoint mechanisms
- Log replay and rollback

### 3. Basic Replication
- Master-slave replication
- Log shipping
- Failover mechanisms
- Consistency guarantees

### 4. Column-store vs Row-store
- Columnar storage format
- Compression techniques
- Analytical query optimization
- Storage format comparison
