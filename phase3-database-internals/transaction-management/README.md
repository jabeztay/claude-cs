# Transaction Management

**Duration:** Week 7-8 (14 days)  
**Phase:** Database Internals

## Learning Objectives
- Understand isolation levels
- Learn about locking and deadlock detection
- Grasp two-phase commit protocol

## Project Goal
Build a transaction manager with concurrency control

## Implementation Features
- ACID transaction support
- Multiple isolation levels
- Deadlock detection and resolution
- Two-phase locking protocol

```

## Isolation Levels
1. **Read Uncommitted:** No isolation
2. **Read Committed:** Prevents dirty reads
3. **Repeatable Read:** Prevents non-repeatable reads
4. **Serializable:** Full isolation

## Locking Mechanisms
- Shared locks (read locks)
- Exclusive locks (write locks)
- Two-phase locking protocol
- Lock escalation strategies

## Deadlock Handling
- Wait-for graph construction
- Deadlock detection algorithms
- Victim selection for deadlock resolution
- Timeout-based deadlock prevention

## Deliverable
Transaction manager with:
- Full ACID compliance
- Multiple isolation levels
- Deadlock detection and resolution
- Two-phase commit support

## Performance Targets
- Minimal locking overhead
- Fast deadlock detection
- High concurrency support
