## Learning Philosophy

- **Build to understand**: Each concept learned through implementation
- **Quality over speed**: Clean, tested code over rushing
- **Iterative development**: Each part informs the next
- **Reflection is key**: Document learnings after each section

## Documentation

- [CURRICULUM.md](CURRICULUM.md) - Complete curriculum with all phases
- [LEARNINGS.md](LEARNINGS.md) - Running journal of insights and breakthroughs
- [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) - Context for AI assistance

## Success Metrics

Not about completion speed, but about:
- Can explain each concept clearly
- Code demonstrates understanding
- Can identify trade-offs in design decisions
- Can connect concepts to real-world systems
