# Advanced Distributed Systems Topics

**Duration:** Week 9-10 (14 days)  
**Phase:** Distributed Systems

## Learning Objectives
- Understand advanced distributed systems concepts
- Learn about Byzantine fault tolerance
- Grasp vector clocks and distributed transactions

## Project Goal
Implement advanced distributed systems features

## Enhancement Options
Choose 2-3 of the following:

### 1. Byzantine Fault Tolerance
- Byzantine agreement protocols
- Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT)
- Malicious node detection
- Consensus under Byzantine failures

### 2. Gossip Protocols
- Epidemic information dissemination
- Membership management
- Failure detection via gossip
- Anti-entropy mechanisms

### 3. Vector Clocks
- Logical time implementation
- Causal ordering of events
- Concurrent event detection
- Distributed debugging

### 4. Distributed Transactions
- Two-phase commit (2PC)
- Three-phase commit (3PC)
- Distributed deadlock detection
- Transaction coordination

## Byzantine Fault Tolerance
- Handles malicious/arbitrary failures
- Requires 3f+1 nodes for f Byzantine failures
- Cryptographic verification
- Agreement despite adversarial behavior

## Gossip Protocols
- Probabilistic message dissemination
- Scalable membership management
- Robust failure detection
- Self-organizing behavior

## Vector Clocks
- Capture causality in distributed systems
- Detect concurrent events
- Enable consistent snapshots
- Support distributed debugging

## Distributed Transactions
- ACID properties across multiple nodes
- Atomic commitment protocols
- Distributed concurrency control
- Recovery from coordinator failures

## Deliverable
Advanced distributed system with:
- 2-3 advanced features implemented
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Performance evaluation
- Integration with core system
