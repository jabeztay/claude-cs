## Raft Algorithm Components
1. **Leader Election:** Select cluster leader
2. **Log Replication:** Replicate commands across nodes
3. **Safety:** Ensure consistency guarantees
4. **Membership Changes:** Handle cluster reconfiguration

## Node States
- **Follower:** Passive state, responds to leaders
- **Candidate:** Seeks election as leader
- **Leader:** Handles client requests and replication

## Consensus Properties
- Safety (never return incorrect result)
- Liveness (progress under majority availability)
- Fault tolerance (handles F failures with 2F+1 nodes)

## Implementation Details
- Heartbeat mechanisms
- Election timeouts
- Log matching property
- Commit index tracking

## Deliverable
Raft implementation with:
- Leader election algorithm
- Log replication mechanism
- Safety guarantees
- Fault tolerance testing

## Performance Targets
- Fast leader election
- Efficient log replication
- Minimal message overhead
