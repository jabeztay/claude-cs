# Fault Tolerance

**Duration:** Week 5-6 (14 days)  
**Phase:** Distributed Systems

## Learning Objectives

- Learn about failure detection
- Grasp data consistency models

## Project Goal
Build fault-tolerant cluster with automated failover

## Implementation Features

## Failure Detection
1. **Heartbeat-based:** Regular health checks
2. **Timeout-based:** Detect unresponsive nodes
3. **Gossip Protocol:** Distributed failure detection
4. **Phi Accrual:** Adaptive failure detection

## Consistency Models
- **Strong Consistency:** All nodes see same data
- **Eventual Consistency:** Convergence over time
- **Causal Consistency:** Preserve causality
- **Session Consistency:** Per-session guarantees

## CAP Theorem Trade-offs
- **CP System:** Consistency + Partition tolerance
- **AP System:** Availability + Partition tolerance
- **CA System:** Consistency + Availability (no partitions)

## Failover Mechanisms
- Leader failover and re-election
- Data replication and recovery
- Load redistribution
- Client request routing

## Deliverable
Fault-tolerant system with:
- Automatic failure detection
- Seamless failover capabilities
- Configurable consistency models
- Network partition handling

## Performance Targets
- Fast failure detection
- Minimal failover time
- High availability guarantees
