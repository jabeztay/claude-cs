# CLAUDE.md

This file provides context to Claude for working with this learning repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a self-paced Computer Science fundamentals curriculum built through practical implementation. The focus is on understanding core CS concepts by building them from scratch with proper engineering practices.

## Learning Philosophy

- **Build to understand**: Each concept is learned by implementation
- **Quality over speed**: Clean, tested, documented code matters more than rushing
- **Iterative development**: Each part informs the next
- **Reflection is key**: Document learnings after each section

```

## Current Status

**Active Phase**: Phase 1 - Computer Systems  
**Current Part**: Part 1 - Stack Calculator  
**Status**: Starting fresh with proper engineering practices

## Engineering Standards

- **Testing**: Write tests to verify functionality (pytest)
- **Documentation**: Clear READMEs and docstrings
- **Code Quality**: Clean, refactored code with type hints
- **Learning Journal**: Regular updates to LEARNINGS.md

## Development Workflow

1. **Design**: Brief design doc before coding
2. **Test**: Write tests for core functionality
3. **Implement**: Build the solution
4. **Refactor**: Clean up after it works
5. **Document**: Update learnings and progress
6. **Review**: Reflect before moving to next part

## How to Help

When working on this repository:
- Focus on understanding over completion
- Suggest improvements to code clarity
- Help identify missing test cases
- Point out connections between concepts
- Encourage documentation of struggles and breakthroughs

## Learning Goals

- Understand computer systems from first principles
- Build strong foundations in data structures
- Demystify database internals
- Grasp distributed systems challenges

## Context for Assistance

- This is a learning repository, not production code
- Prefer clarity to clever optimizations
- Tests should verify understanding, not chase coverage
- Each part should build on previous learnings
- Documentation should capture the learning journey
